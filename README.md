# Rent-management
The Rent Management System is designed for property owners in Mumbai to manage tenant information, rental payments, and property details. It tracks payments, prevents overpayments, and generates reports for overdue payments and total rent collected. The system uses SQL Server to automate payment validation and ensure data integrity.
